# 💫 About Me

### 👋 Hey, I'm Abhi M G  

Although I prefer to got by my initials: **AMG** (I'm a car, _vroom vroom_ 🏎)

Studying CS @ MIT (_Not Massachussetts_ 🥲)

I work on multidisciplinary research projects focused on integrating AI in the domains of healthcare, medicine, bioinformatics, cybersecurity and networking

I also build projects to solve real world issues because software tools should make life easier, not cause frustration 

I like variety in my work and harnessing technologies to build tools that have a positive impact. 

I believe in being a ***Jack of all trades master of ~~none~~ some***
